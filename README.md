**Welcome to the ethical heart of FioreFrame. This repository does not contain our full commercial application; it holds something far more important: the open-source code for our De-Anonymizer model.**

We believe that ethical claims must be backed by transparent, verifiable code. This repository is our commitment to that principle. It is the tangible "Shell of Science" that protects the "Soul of Art" and is guided by our "Core of Philosophy."

Our unique De-Anonymizer is built not to reveal the **person**, but to respectfully understand the **artistic personality** of a memory. It's a technology designed for connection, not identification.

## Core Principles

This project is guided by the three inseparable layers of the FioreFrame philosophy:

* ### üî¨ **The Shell of Science: Ethical by Design**
    Our primary goal is to demonstrate a new paradigm of privacy. This code is engineered to separate artistic essence from personal identity, ensuring that technology serves human dignity. We invite you to inspect, critique, and help us improve this scientific shell.

* ### ‚ú® **The Soul of Art: In Service of Creativity**
    This technology was not built in a vacuum. It was created to solve a real-world challenge: how to connect the soul of a memory with the soul of an artist, fairly and respectfully. Its ultimate purpose is to empower, not replace, human creativity.

* ### ‚ù§Ô∏è **The Core of Philosophy: Verifiable Trust**
    We don't just ask you to trust us; we invite you to verify it. By making this core open-source, we aim to build a community around the principles of transparency, fairness, and conscious creation.
