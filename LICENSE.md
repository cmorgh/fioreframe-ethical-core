# The Seed of Salvation License (for the FioreFrame De-Anonymizer Core) - v1.1

## Preamble: The Transparent Core of a Seed

This repository does not contain the full application code for FioreFrame; rather, it holds its **ethical core**: the de-anonymizer model that guides our choices. We have open-sourced the process of trust itself.

This code is the philosophical core of a seed: a framework built on friendship, trust, and transparency that prioritizes human dignity. This license is designed to protect this core and ensure that wherever it is used, it remains true to these principles.
